# UWP-Extended-Splash-Screen-With-Lottie-Sample
Demonstrates how to use Lottie animations in an Extended Splash Screen in UWP

I just took the official extended splash screen sample (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/create-a-customized-splash-screen) and replaced the progress ring by a Lottie animation:

![ExtendedSplashScreen](Assets/AppStart.gif?raw=true "Extended Splash Screen")

The app's main page shows how a Lottie animation can (more or less) subtly draw attention to a button. Please note that this animation does not loop - unlike the following animated gif:

![MainPage](Assets/AppMain.gif?raw=true "Main Page")
